# Objective: 
Apply NLP techniques learned during the week to solve a real-world NLP task. Instructions:

# Select an NLP Task: 
Choose an NLP task that interests you, such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, or question-answering. Ensure you have access to relevant data for this task.

# Data Preprocessing: 
Preprocess the text data, including cleaning, tokenization, and any necessary text representation (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings).

# Model Selection: 
Select an appropriate NLP model for your task. This could be a traditional machine learning model or a deep learning model like an LSTM or Transformer-based model.

# Model Training: 
Train your selected model on the preprocessed data.

# Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of your model using relevant evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1- score, BLEU score, etc.).

# Results Presentation: 
Present the results of your NLP task, including insights from your model's performance and any challenges encountered.
