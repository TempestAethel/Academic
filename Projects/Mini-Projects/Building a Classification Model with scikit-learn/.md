Mini-Project 2:Building a Classification Model with scikit-learn
- Objective:The objectiveof this assignment is to build a classification model using scikit-learn to predict a binary outcome based on a dataset and evaluate the model's performance.
Instructions:
- Dataset:You can choose a dataset from sklearn'sbuilt-in datasets, or you can select a dataset of your choice from a reliable source. Ensure that the dataset contains both features and a binary target variable (e.g., 0 or 1, Yes or No, etc.). (This step is very very important for learning and hands on.Give students liberty to search and choose the data, it is important for students to find dataset on their own. They will be doing it on a monthly basis in their real job.)
- Using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris/data

Tasks:
Data Loading:Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame (if not using a built-in sklearn dataset). Display the first few rows to get a sense of the data.
Data Preprocessing: Perform necessary data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (if any), and scaling/normalizing numerical features.
Data Splitting:Split the dataset into two parts: a training set (70-80% of the data) and a testing set (20-30% of the data).
Model Selection:Choose at least two classification algorithms from sklearn (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, etc.). Train each model on the training data.
Model Evaluation:Evaluate the performance of each model on the testing set using appropriate classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC. Compare the performance of the models and discuss which one performs better.
Cross-Validation: Imp
Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):If time permits, you can perform hyperparameter tuning on one of the models to see if you can improve its performance. Usetechniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV for this.Conclusion:Summarize your findings. Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the models you tested. Reflect on the importance of data preprocessing in model performance.
