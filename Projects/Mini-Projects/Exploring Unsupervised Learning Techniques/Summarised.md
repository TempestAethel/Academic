# Objective: 
The objective of this assignment is to explore unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction, and understand their applications.

# Tasks:
Clustering Algorithms Implementation:

a. K-Means Clustering: Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm using scikit-learn. Choose an appropriate dataset for clustering and apply K-Means to find natural clusters. Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

b. Hierarchical Clustering: Implement hierarchical clustering using either agglomerative or divisive clustering approaches. Visualize the resulting dendrogram and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hierarchical clustering.

c. DBSCAN: Implement DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) on a dataset with noise and varying density clusters. Explain how DBSCAN works and compare its performance to K- Means.

# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:

a. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a high- dimensional dataset. Visualize the explained variance ratio and discuss the impact of dimensionality reduction on data visualization and modeling.

b. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Implement t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. Compare the results of t-SNE with PCA and explain when each technique is more suitable.

Advanced Clustering Techniques: Research and provide an overview of advanced clustering techniques beyond K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Discuss one advanced technique in detail, including its advantages and real-world applications.

# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Comparison: 
Compare PCA and t-SNE in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, and typical use cases. Create visualizations to illustrate the differences in dimensionality reduction achieved by each method.

Applications of Unsupervised Learning: Explore real-world applications of unsupervised learning, such as anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems. Choose one application and describe how unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to solve a specific problem in that domain. 
Unsupervised learning techniques have a broad range of applications in various domains. Here’s a brief overview of some common applications:

- Anomaly Detection:\
Applications: Fraud detection, network security, and equipment failure prediction.\
Techniques: Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, Autoencoders.
- Customer Segmentation:
Applications: Targeted marketing, personalized recommendations, and customer behavior analysis.\
Techniques: K-Means Clustering, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering.
- Recommendation Systems:\
Applications: Product recommendations, content recommendations, and personalized user experiences.\
Techniques: Matrix Factorization, K-Means Clustering, t-SNE for visualizing user/item clusters.
- Focus on Customer Segmentation:
Customer Segmentation is a classic application of unsupervised learning. It involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups based on similarities in behavior, preferences, or demographics. This segmentation helps businesses tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and services to specific customer needs.

- Problem Description
Suppose we have an e-commerce company and want to understand the different customer groups to create targeted marketing campaigns. We have a dataset containing customer information such as:

Demographics: Age, gender, income.
Behavioral Data: Purchase frequency, average transaction amount, browsing history.
Objective: Segment customers into distinct groups to target marketing strategies effectively.

Application of Unsupervised Learning Techniques
1. Data Preparation:

Normalization: Scale the features to ensure that they contribute equally to the clustering process.
Feature Selection: Choose relevant features for clustering (e.g., purchase frequency, transaction amount).
2. Choosing Clustering Technique:

K-Means Clustering: A widely used technique that divides data into k clusters based on distance metrics.
DBSCAN: Useful for discovering clusters of varying shapes and handling noise.
Hierarchical Clustering: Creates a tree of clusters, which can be useful for understanding the hierarchical relationships between customer groups.
3. Implementing K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

Here’s a step-by-step approach using K-Means Clustering:

```
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

# Simulate some customer data
np.random.seed(42)
data = {
    'Age': np.random.randint(18, 70, 1000),
    'Income': np.random.randint(20000, 100000, 1000),
    'Purchase_Frequency': np.random.randint(1, 20, 1000),
    'Avg_Transaction_Amount': np.random.uniform(10, 500, 1000)
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Data Preprocessing
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(df)

# Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method
inertia = []
for k in range(1, 11):
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k, random_state=42)
    kmeans.fit(X_scaled)
    inertia.append(kmeans.inertia_)

# Plot the Elbow Curve
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))
plt.plot(range(1, 11), inertia, marker='o')
plt.title('Elbow Method for Optimal k')
plt.xlabel('Number of Clusters')
plt.ylabel('Inertia')
plt.show()

# Applying K-Means with optimal number of clusters (e.g., k=4)
optimal_k = 4
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=optimal_k, random_state=42)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)

# Add cluster labels to the original dataframe
df['Cluster'] = clusters

# Visualize the clusters
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
plt.scatter(df['Income'], df['Purchase_Frequency'], c=df['Cluster'], cmap='viridis', s=50)
plt.title('Customer Segmentation')
plt.xlabel('Income')
plt.ylabel('Purchase Frequency')
plt.colorbar(label='Cluster')
plt.show()

# Calculate Silhouette Score
silhouette_avg = silhouette_score(X_scaled, clusters)
print(f'Silhouette Score: {silhouette_avg:.2f}')
```
- Explanation:\
Data Simulation: We simulate a dataset containing customer features.\
Data Preprocessing: Standardize the features to ensure uniformity in scaling.\
Optimal Clusters: Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k).\
K-Means Clustering: Apply K-Means to segment the customers into clusters based on their similarity.\
Visualization: Plot the clusters to understand the segmentation visually.\
Evaluation: Calculate the Silhouette Score to evaluate the clustering quality.
- Benefits of Customer Segmentation:\
Targeted Marketing: Develop personalized marketing campaigns for each customer segment.\
Improved Customer Experience: Tailor products and services to meet the needs of different customer groups.\
Increased Efficiency: Optimize resource allocation by focusing on high-value customer segments.\
By applying unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means clustering, businesses can gain valuable insights into their customer base,leading to more effective marketing strategies and improved customer satisfaction.
