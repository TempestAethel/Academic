# Objective: 
The objective of this assignment is to explore unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering and dimensionality reduction, and understand their applications.

# Tasks:
Clustering Algorithms Implementation:

a. K-Means Clustering: Implement the K-Means clustering algorithm using scikit-learn. Choose an appropriate dataset for clustering and apply K-Means to find natural clusters. Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

b. Hierarchical Clustering: Implement hierarchical clustering using either agglomerative or divisive clustering approaches. Visualize the resulting dendrogram and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of hierarchical clustering.

c. DBSCAN: Implement DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) on a dataset with noise and varying density clusters. Explain how DBSCAN works and compare its performance to K- Means.

# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:

a. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Implement PCA to reduce the dimensionality of a high- dimensional dataset. Visualize the explained variance ratio and discuss the impact of dimensionality reduction on data visualization and modeling.

b. t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Implement t-SNE to visualize high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions. Compare the results of t-SNE with PCA and explain when each technique is more suitable.

Advanced Clustering Techniques: Research and provide an overview of advanced clustering techniques beyond K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. Discuss one advanced technique in detail, including its advantages and real-world applications.

# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Comparison: 
Compare PCA and t-SNE in terms of their strengths, weaknesses, and typical use cases. Create visualizations to illustrate the differences in dimensionality reduction achieved by each method.

Applications of Unsupervised Learning: Explore real-world applications of unsupervised learning, such as anomaly detection, customer segmentation, and recommendation systems. Choose one application and describe how unsupervised learning techniques can be applied to solve a specific problem in that domain. 

Presentation: Prepare a presentation summarizing your findings and insights from the assignment. Include visualizations, code snippets, and explanations to support your conclusions. Present your findings to your peers or colleagues to encourage discussions on the use of unsupervised learning techniques.
