## Slide 4: Updated Workflow
### Workflow Overview:
1. **`Parameters.m`:**  
   - Defines key system parameters and transfer functions.  
   - Easily configurable for various scenarios.  

2. **`implementation.m`:**  
   - Implements and simulates the antenna system.  
   - Saves simulation data to `Implementation_Results.mat`.  

3. **`analysis.m`:**  
   - Analyzes the results from `implementation.m`.  
   - Computes phase noise, jitter, and other performance metrics.

## Slide 5: Implementation Details
### Key Components:
- **`Parameters.m`:**  
  - Defines PLL loop bandwidth, phase margin, and phase noise settings.  
  - Includes transfer functions for PFD, VCO, loop filter, and divider.  

- **`implementation.m`:**  
  - Simulates the step response and frequency response.  
  - Generates and saves simulation data for analysis.  

- **`analysis.m`:**  
  - Computes phase noise contributions and RMS jitter.  
  - Generates plots for phase noise spectrum, step response, and frequency response.
