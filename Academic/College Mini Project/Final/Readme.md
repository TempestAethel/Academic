# Project Folder Structure Overview

This document provides an overview of the folder structure for the project and describes the contents of each folder and file.

---

## **[Programs Folder](./Programs/)**

This folder contains all the program files used for the antenna simulation and analysis:

- **[Parameters.m](./Programs/Parameters.m)**:  
  Contains the system parameters and transfer functions. It defines the loop filter, VCO, and PLL configurations, which are essential for simulating the antenna system.

- **[Implementation.m](./Programs/Implementation.m)**:  
  Implements the system simulation based on the parameters defined in **Parameters.m**. It computes the step response and frequency response of the closed-loop system and saves the results to a `.mat` file.

- **[Analysis.m](./Programs/Analysis.m)**:  
  Processes the simulation results saved by **Implementation.m** and analyzes the phase noise, RMS jitter, and system performance. It generates various plots to visualize the results.

- **[Readme.md](./Programs/Readme.md)**:  
  This file contains a summary of all the program files and explains their purpose and usage in the overall project.

## **[LineByLine Folder](./LineByLine/)**

This folder contains line-by-line analysis of the MATLAB scripts used in the project:

- **[Parameters_manual.md](./LineByLine/Parameters_manual.md)**:  
  A detailed line-by-line analysis of the **Parameters.m** script, explaining each parameter and transfer function defined for the antenna simulation.

- **[Implementation_manual.md](./LineByLine/Implementation_manual.md)**:  
  A detailed line-by-line analysis of the **Implementation.m** script, explaining how the simulation is executed and how the results are saved.

- **[Analysis_manual.md](./LineByLine/Analysis_manual.md)**:  
  A detailed line-by-line analysis of the **Analysis.m** script, explaining how the results from **Implementation.m** are processed and how the phase noise, RMS jitter, and system performance are analyzed.

## **[Output Folder](./Output/)**

This folder contains the output files generated after running the **Implementation.m** script and analyzing the results:

- **[Implementation_Results.mat](./Output/Implementation_Results.mat)**:  
  This `.mat` file contains the simulation data generated by running **Implementation.m**. It includes the time-domain and frequency-domain responses of the system, which are later used for analysis.

- **[Readme.md](./Output/Readme.md)**:  
  This file provides instructions on how to execute the program files, including steps to run **Implementation.m** and analyze the results using **Analysis.m**.

- **[Output.md](./Output/Output.md)**:  
  Contains a detailed explanation of the output generated by the simulation and analysis, including how to interpret the results (e.g., phase noise spectrum, RMS jitter, etc.).

- **[images](./Output/images/)**:  
  This subfolder contains images used in the **readme.md** file. These images help visualize the analysis results and provide graphical representations of the system performance.

## **[NOTAzz Folder](./NOTAzz/)**

This folder contains documentation on functions and commands that fall outside the scope of the other folders:

- **[Functions.md](./NOTAzz/Functions.md)**:  
  This file provides an explanation of the MATLAB functions and commands used in the project. It details the syntax and purpose of each function, including **run**, **tf**, **step**, **bode**, and others, explaining how they are applied to process the system parameters, simulate the antenna system, and analyze the results.
