## **2. Data File**

### **2.1. Simulation Results**
- **File Name**: `Implementation_Results.mat`
- **Description**: 
  - A MATLAB `.mat` file containing the results of the simulations performed in `implementation.m`.
  - Includes all necessary data for post-simulation analysis in `analysis.m`.
- **Contents**:
  - `t`: Time vector for step response.
  - `y`: Step response data.
  - `w`: Frequency vector for open-loop response.
  - `mag`: Magnitude response of the open-loop system.
  - `phase`: Phase response of the open-loop system.
  - `mag_dB`: Magnitude response in dB.

## **Usage Notes**
1.  `.png` files used for visual analysis of PLL system behavior.
2. The `.mat` file can be loaded into MATLAB for further processing or custom analysis.
3. Ensure that `Implementation_Results.mat` is in the MATLAB path before running `analysis.m`.
