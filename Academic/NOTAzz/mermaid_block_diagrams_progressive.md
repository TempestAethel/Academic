# Mermaid Block Diagram Examples with Code and Diagram Side by Side

This document demonstrates how to create block diagrams using Mermaid syntax. Each code snippet is shown alongside its diagram.

## Simple Block Diagram

Here is the simplest example of a block diagram with just a start and end:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[End]
```

### Explanation:
- `graph TD`: Top-down graph.
- `A[Start] --> B[End]`: A simple flow from start to end.


---

## Conditional Flow

Next, we introduce a conditional flow that branches based on a decision.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
    B -->|No| D[Action 2]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E[End]
```

### Explanation:
- The diagram uses a decision block (`B{Decision?}`) to branch the flow.


---

## Process with Loop

This example includes a process with a loop where actions are repeated until a condition is met.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B[Perform Action]
    B --> C{Action Successful?}
    C -->|Yes| D[End]
    C -->|No| B
```

### Explanation:
- The loop will continue if the action is not successful, repeating until it is.


---

## Sequential Process Flow

Here is a sequential flow showing multiple steps in a process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Step 1] --> B[Step 2]
    B --> C[Step 3]
    C --> D[Step 4]
    D --> E[Finish]
```

### Explanation:
- Each step occurs in order from left to right.


---

## Complex Process with Multiple Conditions

Here is a more complex block diagram involving multiple decision points.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Start] --> B[Prepare Data]
    B --> C{Data Valid?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Process Data]
    C -->|No| E[Fix Data]
    D --> F{More Data?}
    F -->|Yes| B
    F -->|No| G[End]
    E --> B
```

### Explanation:
- The flow checks if the data is valid. If not, it fixes the data and re-processes it.
- It also loops if thereâ€™s more data to process.

## Multi-Stage Decision Process

A more advanced example with multiple stages and decision points:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start Process] --> B[Stage 1]
    B --> C{Condition 1?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Proceed to Stage 2]
    C -->|No| E[Handle Issue]
    D --> F[Stage 2]
    F --> G{Condition 2?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Complete Process]
    G -->|No| I[Handle Issue]
    E --> B
    I --> F
```

### Explanation:
- The flow moves through two stages with multiple conditions and decision points at each stage.


---

## Final Complex Flow with Multiple Parallel Paths

Finally, a very complex flow showing parallel paths with interdependencies.

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Start] --> B[Initialize Process]
    B --> C{Check Dependencies}
    C -->|OK| D[Process Data]
    C -->|Not OK| E[Resolve Issues]
    D --> F{Process Complete?}
    E --> F
    F -->|Yes| G[End]
    F -->|No| D
    G --> H[Final Verification]
    H --> I{All Tests Passed?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Success]
    I -->|No| K[Rework Process]
    J --> L[End]
    K --> D
```

### Explanation:
- The diagram uses both conditional branches and parallel paths to handle various scenarios.
- After the main process, final verification tests are performed, determining success or failure.

## Rendering Mermaid Diagrams

To render Mermaid diagrams:
- You need a platform that supports Mermaid, such as GitHub, GitLab, or some Markdown editors like Typora or Visual Studio Code with the appropriate extensions.
