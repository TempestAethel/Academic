### Early Life and Inspiration  
Muhammad Yunus was born on June 28, 1940, in Chittagong, Bangladesh. He studied economics and received his PhD from Vanderbilt University in the United States. Upon returning to Bangladesh, Yunus began teaching economics at Chittagong University. His encounter with poverty during the famine of 1974 in Bangladesh deeply affected him and led him to reconsider traditional economic models that ignored the poor. 

- **Key Decision:** Shifting from traditional economics to focus on solving poverty through financial inclusion.  
- **Impact:** Yunus recognized that traditional banking systems failed to serve the poor, which led him to create a model of lending that provided small loans to individuals who had no access to traditional financial services.

### Founding Grameen Bank  
In the late 1970s, Yunus began experimenting with lending small amounts of money to the poor in rural Bangladesh. He initially gave personal loans to women in a village to help them start small businesses, using his own money. This informal experiment evolved into the idea for **Grameen Bank**, which was formally established in 1983. The bank’s unique model, which provided loans to the poor without requiring collateral, was based on trust rather than formal credit assessments.

- **Key Decision:** Creating a bank focused on lending small amounts to the poor, particularly women, without collateral.  
- **Impact:** The Grameen Bank model empowered individuals, especially women, to start businesses and improve their lives, helping break the cycle of poverty. It proved that micro-lending could be a viable financial model for poor communities.

### Overcoming Challenges and Scaling Up  
Initially, Grameen Bank faced skepticism from the banking industry and policymakers, who doubted that the poor would be able to repay loans without collateral. However, Yunus and his team persisted, refining the model and showing that borrowers in rural communities could repay loans with high repayment rates. The success of Grameen Bank led to its recognition as an innovative solution to poverty.

- **Key Decision:** Persisting in the face of skepticism and refining the microfinance model.  
- **Impact:** Yunus proved that lending to the poor, especially women, was not only possible but also financially sustainable, inspiring microfinance programs around the world.

Grameen Bank’s success allowed it to scale, and by the early 2000s, it had provided loans to millions of poor individuals in Bangladesh and other countries. Yunus continued to innovate, introducing new programs such as microinsurance and micro savings accounts for the poor.

- **Key Decision:** Expanding Grameen Bank’s services beyond loans to include savings and insurance for the poor.  
- **Impact:** This broadened the bank’s reach and further integrated the poor into the formal financial system, contributing to economic stability for individuals and communities.
