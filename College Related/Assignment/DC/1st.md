# (8,4) Linear Block Code Problem

## Question:
The parity clock bits of a (8,4) block code are generated by:

- \(C_5 = d_1 + d_2 + d_4\)
- \(C_6 = d_1 + d_2 + d_3\)
- \(C_7 = d_1 + d_3 + d_4\)
- \(C_8 = d_2 + d_3 + d_4\)

where \(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4\) are message bits.

1. Find the generator matrix and parity check matrix.
2. Find the code word for all the messages.
3. Draw encoder and decoder circuit.
4. How many errors can it detect and correct?
5. Write the standard array.

## Solution:

### **(i) Generator Matrix (\(G\)) and Parity Check Matrix (\(H\))**

#### Codeword Structure
The codeword \(\mathbf{C}\) for a linear block code can be represented as:
\[
\mathbf{C} = [d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, C_5, C_6, C_7, C_8]
\]
where \(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4\) are the message bits and \(C_5, C_6, C_7, C_8\) are parity bits calculated as follows:
- \(C_5 = d_1 + d_2 + d_4\)
- \(C_6 = d_1 + d_2 + d_3\)
- \(C_7 = d_1 + d_3 + d_4\)
- \(C_8 = d_2 + d_3 + d_4\)

#### Generator Matrix (\(G\))
The generator matrix maps the 4-bit message (\(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4\)) to an 8-bit codeword (\(\mathbf{C}\)). It is:
\[
G = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

#### Parity Check Matrix (\(H\))
The parity check matrix satisfies the property:
\[
H \cdot \mathbf{C}^T = 0
\]
The parity check matrix is:
\[
H = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\]

### **(ii) Codewords for All Messages**

To generate the codewords for all possible 4-bit messages, multiply each message vector by the generator matrix (\(G\)):
\[
\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{d} \cdot G
\]
For all 16 possible messages (\(\mathbf{d} = [0000, 0001, \dots, 1111]\)), compute the codewords:

| Message (\(\mathbf{d}\)) | Codeword (\(\mathbf{C}\)) |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| 0000                     | 00000000                 |
| 0001                     | 00010111                 |
| 0010                     | 00101110                 |
| 0011                     | 00111001                 |
| 0100                     | 01011101                 |
| 0101                     | 01001010                 |
| 0110                     | 01110011                 |
| 0111                     | 01100100                 |
| 1000                     | 10011100                 |
| 1001                     | 10001011                 |
| 1010                     | 10110010                 |
| 1011                     | 10100101                 |
| 1100                     | 11000001                 |
| 1101                     | 11010110                 |
| 1110                     | 11101111                 |
| 1111                     | 11111000                 |

### **(iii) Encoder and Decoder Circuit**

#### Encoder
- The encoder uses XOR gates to compute parity bits (\(C_5, C_6, C_7, C_8\)) based on the message bits.

#### Decoder
- The decoder uses the parity check matrix \(H\) to compute the syndrome:
\[
\mathbf{s} = H \cdot \mathbf{r}^T
\]
The syndrome \(\mathbf{s}\) identifies the error pattern.

I can draw the circuits if you'd like.

---

### **(iv) Error Detection and Correction Capability**

#### Detection
- The code detects up to **3 errors**, as it can differentiate any received word from valid codewords.

#### Correction
- The code corrects up to **1 error**, as it identifies and corrects single-bit errors using the syndrome.

---

### **(v) Standard Array**

The standard array lists the valid codewords and their associated error patterns. Construct it by arranging all codewords in the first column, with each subsequent row representing error patterns added to the codewords.

Let me know if you'd like to see the detailed construction of the standard array!
