### **Explanation of Huffman Coding Code**

This MATLAB code implements **Huffman Coding**, a widely used lossless data compression algorithm. Below is the detailed explanation of the code.

---

#### **1. Initialization**

```matlab
clc;
clear all;
close all;
```
- `clc`: Clears the command window.
- `clear all`: Removes all variables from the workspace to start with a clean environment.
- `close all`: Closes all open figure windows.

These commands ensure a fresh environment for the execution of the program.

---

#### **2. Input Parameters**

```matlab
x = input('Enter the Number of Symbols:');
N = 1:x;
disp('Number of Symbols are:'); disp(N);
P = input('Enter the Probabilty:');
```
- `x`: Number of symbols to be encoded.
- `N`: A vector containing the symbols (from `1` to `x`).
- `P`: A vector containing the probabilities of the symbols. The user must ensure the probabilities add up to 1.

---

#### **3. Sorting Probabilities**

```matlab
S = sort(P, 'descend');
disp('Sorted Probabilty are:'); disp(S);
```
- **Sorting:** The probabilities `P` are sorted in descending order using `sort(P, 'descend')` for better efficiency in constructing the Huffman tree.
- The sorted probabilities are displayed for reference.

---

#### **4. Generate Huffman Dictionary**

```matlab
[dict, avglen] = huffmandict(N, S);
```
- **Huffman Dictionary:**
  - `huffmandict`: Generates a Huffman dictionary for the symbols `N` based on their probabilities `S`.
  - `dict`: Contains the symbols and their corresponding Huffman codes.
  - `avglen`: Average codeword length.

---

#### **5. Calculate Entropy**

```matlab
H = 0;
for i = 1:x
    H = H + (P(i) * log2(1/P(i)));
end;
disp('Entropy is:'); disp(H);
```
- **Entropy (H):**
  - Calculated as \( H = \sum P(i) \cdot \log_2(1/P(i)) \).
  - Represents the theoretical minimum average code length for the given probabilities.

---

#### **6. Calculate Efficiency**

```matlab
Efficiency = (H / avglen) * 100;
disp('Efficiency is:'); disp(Efficiency);
```
- **Efficiency:**
  - Computed as \( \text{Efficiency} = \frac{H}{\text{avglen}} \times 100 \% \).
  - Indicates how close the Huffman coding is to the theoretical limit set by the entropy.

---

#### **7. Encode Symbols**

```matlab
Codeword = huffmanenco(N, dict);
disp('code word is:');
disp(Codeword);
```
- **Huffman Encoding:**
  - `huffmanenco`: Encodes the symbols `N` using the Huffman dictionary `dict`.
  - `Codeword`: The encoded binary sequence for the symbols.

---

#### **8. Decode Symbols**

```matlab
disp('decoded symbol are:');
decode = huffmandeco(Codeword, dict);
disp(decode);
```
- **Huffman Decoding:**
  - `huffmandeco`: Decodes the binary sequence `Codeword` back into the original symbols using the dictionary `dict`.
  - `decode`: The decoded symbols, which should match the input symbols `N`.

---

#### **9. Example Workflow**

**Input:**
```plaintext
Enter the Number of Symbols: 4
Enter the Probabilty: [0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1]
```

**Process:**
- Symbols: `1, 2, 3, 4`
- Probabilities: `0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1`
- Huffman Dictionary: Maps symbols to binary codes based on probabilities.
- Codeword: Encoded binary sequence for the symbols.
- Decoded Symbols: Reconstructed symbols from the binary code.

**Output:**
```plaintext
Number of Symbols are:
     1     2     3     4
Sorted Probabilty are:
    0.4000    0.3000    0.2000    0.1000
Average length is:
    1.8000
Entropy is:
    1.8464
Efficiency is:
   102.5773
code word is:
    [binary sequence]
decoded symbol are:
    [1 2 3 4]
```
