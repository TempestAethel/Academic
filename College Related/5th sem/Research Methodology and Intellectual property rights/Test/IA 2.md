## **Part 1: Copyright**

### <a name="q1"></a>1. **Explain the criteria that an original work must meet to qualify for copyright protection.**  

To qualify for copyright protection, a work must fulfill specific criteria as defined under **The Copyright Act, 1957**. Copyright protects original expressions of ideas, not the ideas themselves. The main criteria include:

---

1. **Existence in Tangible Form**  
   - The work must exist in some **physical (tangible)** form.  
   - Copyright does not protect ideas, concepts, or thoughts unless they are expressed in a tangible medium like paper, digital format, canvas, etc.  
   - **Example:** A written story, a painting, or a music recording meets this criterion.

---

2. **Originality of Work**  
   - The work must be **original**, meaning it should be independently created by the author.  
   - Originality does not require novelty or uniqueness but must reflect the author's **own intellectual effort**.  
   - Even works with minimal creativity can qualify for copyright protection.  
   - **Example:** A simple poem or sketch, as long as it originates from the author, can be protected.

---

3. **Minimal Creative Effort**  
   - A work must demonstrate **at least some creativity**.  
   - It should not be a mere **mechanical effort** or duplication of an existing work.  
   - **Example:** An address book with alphabetically listed numbers does not qualify, but a creatively designed and arranged phone directory can.

---

4. **Human Authorship**  
   - Copyright protection applies only to works created by **human authors**.  
   - Works generated entirely by machines or natural processes without human intervention are not protected.  
   - **Example:** A photograph clicked by a human qualifies, but a picture clicked by an automated camera without human input may not.

---

5. **Not Derived from Pre-existing Work**  
   - The work must not be a **direct copy** of an existing work.  
   - It can, however, be inspired by other works, provided it exhibits significant differences and **independent effort**.  
   - **Example:** A unique adaptation of a story or film can qualify for copyright.

---

### **Summary**  
In conclusion, for a work to qualify for copyright protection, it must:  
- Exist in a tangible form,  
- Be original and reflect intellectual effort,  
- Demonstrate minimal creativity,  
- Have human authorship, and  
- Not directly copy pre-existing works.  

This ensures that creators receive **exclusive rights** to their work while promoting creativity and innovation.
