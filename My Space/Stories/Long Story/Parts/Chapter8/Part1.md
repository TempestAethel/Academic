# Unspoken Expectations

## Chapter 8: Rekindled Paths  

Spring arrived quietly, the last traces of winter melting away as the campus came alive with color. Ethan was sitting under a blooming cherry tree, his journal balanced on his knee, when he heard a familiar voice behind him.  

“Is this your new hiding spot?”  

He turned to see Maya standing a few feet away, her smile tentative but genuine. She looked different—calmer, more grounded.  

“Something like that,” Ethan said, closing his journal and gesturing to the empty spot on the bench beside him. “What brings you here?”  

Maya hesitated for a moment before sitting down. “I was just walking around, and I saw you. Thought I’d say hi.”  

Ethan nodded, his chest tightening. It had been weeks since they’d spoken, and though he’d missed her, he wasn’t sure how to bridge the gap that had grown between them.

For a while, they sat in comfortable silence, the soft rustling of leaves filling the air. Then Maya spoke, her voice quiet.  

“I’ve been thinking a lot,” she said, her gaze fixed on the ground. “About everything. About us.”  

Ethan didn’t say anything, letting her find her words.  

“I think I’ve been unfair to you,” she continued. “I’ve been so focused on what I wanted—what I needed—that I didn’t stop to think about what you needed. And I’m sorry for that.”  

Ethan exhaled slowly, her words settling over him like a gentle breeze. “Maya, you don’t have to apologize. We were both trying to figure things out. It wasn’t easy for either of us.”  

She looked at him then, her eyes shimmering with emotion. “I just don’t want you to think I didn’t care about what you were going through. Because I did. I still do.”  

“I know,” Ethan said softly. “And I care about you too. But I think we both needed the space to grow on our own.”  

Maya nodded, a faint smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah. I think you’re right.”

Over the next few weeks, they began to find a new rhythm—one that felt lighter, freer.  

They started meeting for coffee again, their conversations filled with laughter and stories about the things they’d been doing during their time apart. Ethan told her about the new poetry class he’d taken, and Maya showed him pictures of her latest paintings, each one more vibrant than the last.  

It was different now—less intense, less weighted by the expectations they’d once placed on each other.

One afternoon, as they sat by the lake, Maya turned to Ethan with a thoughtful expression.  

“Do you ever think about what might’ve happened if we’d met later? After we’d both figured ourselves out a little more?”  

Ethan smiled faintly, his gaze drifting to the water. “Sometimes. But I think meeting when we did taught us a lot. About ourselves, about what we want—and don’t want.”  

Maya nodded, her smile soft. “Yeah. I guess you’re right.”  

She hesitated for a moment, then added, “I’m glad we’re here now, though. Even if it’s different.”  

“Me too,” Ethan said, his voice warm.

Though their connection had changed, it hadn’t diminished. If anything, their friendship felt stronger now, built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding.  

There were still moments when the past lingered between them—a shared look, a fleeting touch—but they both knew where the boundaries were, and they were careful not to cross them.  

And as the weeks turned into months, Ethan and Maya found themselves walking a path that felt steady and sure—a path that led not to what they’d once had, but to something new and just as meaningful.  

Because sometimes, love doesn’t have to mean holding on. Sometimes, it means letting go and finding your way back to each other as something entirely different.
