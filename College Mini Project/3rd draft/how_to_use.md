# How to Use These Files for Phase Noise Analysis and Antenna Design

This document guides you on how to:
1. Set parameters for your system.
2. Implement simulations based on these parameters.
3. Analyze phase noise and other performance metrics.

## Files Overview
- **`Parameters.m`**: Defines system parameters, constants, and transfer functions. This is the foundation for your simulations and analyses.
- **`implementation.m`**: Simulates the system using the parameters defined in `Parameters.m`.
- **`analysis.m`**: Performs detailed analysis, including phase noise evaluation and jitter computation, using the results from `implementation.m`.

---

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Set Parameters
1. Open **`Parameters.m`** in MATLAB.
2. Modify the parameters as needed for your system. For example:
   - Adjust the **PLL loop bandwidth** (`LoopBW`) or **phase margin** (`PM`).
   - Change the **VCO phase noise levels** (`VCO_PN_L`) or other noise settings.
3. Save the file after making changes.

### 2. Implement the System
1. Run **`implementation.m`** in MATLAB :

2. This script will:
   - Load the parameters from `Parameters.m`.
   - Implement and simulate the system (e.g., step response, frequency response).
   - Save the simulation results to `Implementation_Results.mat`.
3. Check the MATLAB Command Window for messages confirming successful execution.

### 3. Analyze Results
1. Run **`analysis.m`** in MATLAB :

2. This script will:
   - Load the parameters from `Parameters.m` and results from `Implementation_Results.mat`.
   - Compute and visualize phase noise, transfer functions, and RMS jitter.
3. Review the generated plots:
   - **Phase Noise Spectrum**: Overall phase noise contributions.
   - **Step Response**: Closed-loop system behavior.
   - **Frequency Response**: Open-loop gain magnitude and phase.
4. RMS jitter will be displayed in the Command Window.

## Example Use Case
Suppose you want to study how changing the **loop bandwidth** affects phase noise:
1. Open `Parameters.m` and adjust the `LoopBW` value (e.g., change from `2e6` to `3e6`).
2. Save the file.
3. Run `implementation.m` to simulate the system with the new parameters.
4. Run `analysis.m` to analyze the updated results.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error: Undefined Variable**: Ensure `Parameters.m` is in the same directory as the other scripts.
- **No Plots Shown**: Verify that MATLAB's plotting is enabled and no errors occurred during execution.
- **Unexpected Results**: Double-check parameter values and ensure they are physically realistic.

---

## Output Files
- **`Implementation_Results.mat`**: Contains the simulation data generated by `implementation.m`.
- **Plots**: `analysis.m` will generate various plots to visualize system performance.
