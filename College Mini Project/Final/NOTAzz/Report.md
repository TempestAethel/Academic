## Abstract


High-frequency antenna systems often face challenges such as phase noise, low spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), and insertion loss, which degrade signal quality and overall performance. This project addresses these challenges by designing and simulating a phase-locked loop (PLL)-based antenna system using MATLAB and Simulink.

The project focuses on simulating phase noise in local oscillators and mitigating it through PLL implementation. Key aspects include analyzing power consumption, improving SFDR using direct demodulation techniques, and minimizing insertion loss in transmission lines. Noise figure analysis is also performed to ensure optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By leveraging advanced simulation tools, this project aims to enhance antenna performance in ultra-high-speed communication systems, delivering improved signal integrity and system reliability.


## Introduction

High-frequency antenna systems are critical for modern communication, enabling the efficient transmission and reception of signals over long distances. However, such systems face significant challenges, including phase noise in local oscillators, high power consumption, low spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), and insertion loss. These factors degrade the signal quality, reduce system performance, and hinder reliable communication in ultra-high-speed systems.

Phase noise, a major issue in local oscillators, leads to signal distortion, which negatively impacts the overall stability of communication systems. Similarly, high power consumption in analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) adds inefficiency, while a low SFDR results in increased signal distortion and limited dynamic range. Insertion loss in transmission lines further degrades signal strength, reducing overall system reliability.

This project aims to address these challenges by designing and simulating an advanced antenna system using MATLAB and Simulink. The implementation of phase-locked loops (PLLs) will reduce phase noise, while optimized designs will improve SFDR, reduce power consumption, and minimize insertion loss. Additionally, noise figure analysis will ensure an enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). By focusing on these aspects, this project seeks to deliver a robust and high-performance antenna system suitable for ultra-high-frequency communication applications.

## Aim

To design and develop an advanced antenna system with improved performance by mitigating phase noise, enhancing spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), minimizing insertion loss, and optimizing power consumption using MATLAB and Simulink simulations.

## Objectives

1. To simulate phase noise in local oscillators and study its effects on antenna system performance.  
2. To implement a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) in Simulink to stabilize the signal and reduce phase noise.  
3. To analyze the system's performance before and after phase noise reduction, ensuring improved signal integrity and stability.

### Evaluating RF Hardware Characteristics for Automotive JCRS Systems Based on PMCW-CDMA at 77 GHz

#### Summary

This paper evaluates the impact of radio frequency (RF) hardware characteristics on the performance of joint communications and radar sensing (JCRS) systems operating at 77 GHz. The authors extend their previously published vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications model to a JCRS model, incorporating the entire physical layer including RF hardware representations, the channel, and digital signal processing blocks for both communications and sensing. They analyze the influence of non-ideal hardware components and characteristics, such as S-parameters, noise, and non-linearity of amplifiers, on the bit error rate of communications and the mean deviation of detected distance and velocity. The results show that the noise of the low-noise amplifier at the receiver side has the most significant impact, while the noise generated by the power amplifier at the transmitter has negligible effect due to the high signal power. The non-linearity of amplifiers at the transmitter also significantly impacts the available sensing range by limiting and compressing signal power. The authors provide design recommendations and criteria for future JCRS systems based on these findings.

#### Key Points

- Provided design recommendations and criteria for future JCRS systems based on the evaluation results
- Made the models freely available to the public

### Low Power Analog Processing for Ultra-High-Speed Receivers With RF Correlation

#### Summary

This paper presents a novel low-power analog processing (LPAP) receiver design that can support multiple modulations, including the highest 16-QAM modulation reported so far for direct-demodulation with RF correlation.
