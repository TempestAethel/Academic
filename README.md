# File-Reserve

Welcome to the **File-Reserve** repository!

This is a simple repository that I've created to store non-code related documents. It serves as a personal repository for text-based files, notes, drafts, and other miscellaneous resources that don't fit within my main coding projects.

### Purpose:
- **Non-Code Documents**: This repository is intended for storing various documents like text notes, research drafts, outlines, and other written content that doesn't directly relate to the code repositories I maintain elsewhere.
- **Backup & Archiving**: It serves as a backup for my personal writing and research, making it easy to access important text files across different devices.
- **Organization**: As a developer and hobbyist, I often generate content in the form of text documents. This repository helps me organize and manage these materials in a centralized location.

### Files You May Find Here:
- Drafts of articles, essays, or stories.
- Personal notes for coding or non-coding projects.
- Research documents or outlines.
- Any other files related to my work and learning that aren't code-based.

### Note:
While this repository doesn't contain source code for my projects, it still plays an important role in my work by keeping my written resources organized. Feel free to explore or use this repository as a reference for your own note-taking or document archiving needs!

Thank you for visiting!
